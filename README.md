# Barebones_Apparel_Website_Template
This is a sample website I made to give some of my creative friends to use for their clothing brands. I am friends with quite a few entrepreneurs who've
decided to create their own clothing brands. I figured if I made a website template, I could send this to each friend and allow them to make the changes they want, and direct traffic to their (this) website, instead of directing customers to their Instagram and TikTok pages.
